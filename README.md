# Meridian Workshop

A Claude Code workshop. You're a consultant responding to an RFP, then delivering the engagement.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd meridian-workshop
claude
```

That's it. Say hi — Claude will take it from there.

## If you get disconnected

Just run `claude` again in this directory. Progress is tracked in `docs/PROGRESS.md`; Claude will pick up where you left off.

## What's in here

- `docs/rfp/` — the RFP and client background
- `proposal/` — your response goes here (starts empty)
- `client/`, `server/` — the application you'll be working on in Act 2
- `.claude/` — project-level Claude Code config (agents, commands, skills) left by the previous vendor
